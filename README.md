# CSS Animations and Transitions
This repository is a bunch of cool, fun, and cross-browser animations for you to use in your projects. Great for emphasis, home pages, sliders, and general just-add-water-awesomeness. No dependencies.

#### CSS Animation
An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want. To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation. Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

#### CSS Transitions
CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration. 

###### To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

CSS property you want to add an effect to.
Duration of the effect.

**Note:** If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.
